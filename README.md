# Teaching Resources

A collection of materials/resources for teaching technology.

## My courses

* [Advanced JavaScript](https://github.com/advanced-js/syllabus) – an 18-contact hour continuing ed. class
    * See the [meta](https://github.com/advanced-js/syllabus/blob/master/meta.md) page for information for teachers.
* [Building for Learning](https://github.com/bfl-itp/syllabus) – a graduate course I taught at [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/) about building interactive educational tools, covering front-end web development and learning design
* [NYTech](https://github.com/cuny-nytech/syllabus/) – basically "practical skills for CS students"

## Other things I work(ed) on

* [The GitHub Education guide](https://education.github.com/guide) – helping teachers use GitHub in their classrooms
    * [teachers_pet](https://github.com/education/teachers_pet) – the associated Ruby gem for managing large numbers of repositories
* [Hacker Hours](http://hackerhours.org/) – office hours for people learning to code that I organize. In particular, see:
    * [The DIY Guide](http://hackerhours.org/diy-guide.html) – a guide for people wanting to organize community-oriented office hours or meetups
    * [The Resources page](http://hackerhours.org/resources.html) – useful links for people new to software development
