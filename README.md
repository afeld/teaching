# Teaching Resources

A collection of materials/resources for teaching technology.

## My courses

    * See the [meta](https://github.com/advanced-js/syllabus/blob/master/meta.md) page for information for teachers.
* [Building for Learning](https://github.com/bfl-itp/syllabus) – a graduate course I taught at [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/) about building interactive educational tools, covering front-end web development and learning design
* [NYTech](https://github.com/cuny-nytech/syllabus/) – basically "practical skills for CS students"
